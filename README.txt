I initially got hooked by technology in 2014, when co-funding Grupo Quente – an online marketplace inspired by Groupon's business model. Grupo Quente’s sale allowed me to pursue my career in music: I have been a professional producer, singer, and guitarist for 13+ years in Brazil. However, I was itching to get back to technology and decided to stop music in 2019, and I moved to the United States to restart my professional career.
I launched Beyond Puzzle – an e-commerce puzzle store. I took a few computer programming classes trying to optimize my store and found a new passion: I fell in love with software engineering, which led me to join App Academy.

Since then, I dedicated all my time and energy to learning, improving, and growing within that field by helping small and medium-sized businesses reach their goals.
